I'm a first Year Engineering PhD @ the University of Oxford working on efficient memory architectures & optimizations for AI systems/accelerators. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my MEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Nottingham (First Class) in 2025. During my undergraduate studies, I completed two summer internships at Qualcomm working in the Physical Design team and the R&D Lab team as part of my UKESF scholarship. I also spent a month as a Research Assistant at the University of Oxford researching GPU memory architectures as a prefix to starting my DPhil in Engineering in October 2025.

I am a member of the **Oxford Secure Computer Architecture Research (OSCAR)** group as well as a contributor to the **Computing infrastructure Group**. My PhD (Oxford calls them DPhils) is fully funded by the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) as part of Oxford-based Project GLASS which aims to design the next generation of AI systems from physical layer design to the Applicaiton layer.

My research interests are in next-generation Memory Architectures and Memory Optimizations for better, more efficient AI systems.
